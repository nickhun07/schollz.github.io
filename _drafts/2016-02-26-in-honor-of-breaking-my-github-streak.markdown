40 days of programming. I broke my Github streak. In honor of this achievement, I wanted to take a look back at exactly what I've done.

`git log --since="2016-01-17" --format=oneline | wc -l`

Here's what I made in the last 40 days. It turns out there is a lot you can do when you put yourself to coding everyday. My goal for the last 40 days was to commit code to any repo (BitBucket or Github) that was helpful/useful. Somedays there wasn't much - about 10 days I just had 1 commit. Still, these 1-commit days turned out to be really useful as I usually used them to improve on READMEs...something that I never really took the time to do before.

AwwKoala is yet another wiki. I'm proud of this one as it carries the functionality that I have always wanted in a wiki (listifying for crossing/uncrossing) and the utter simplicity that seems always missing from the thousands of wikis out there.

# tldr;

You can do a lot if you commit yourself (pun intended) to pushing code every day.
