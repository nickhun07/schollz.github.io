description: What were the science ideas that succeeded and failed?
---

*Not including rotations*

*All these are projects that I spent at least a week on, sometimes quite more*

# Working on

1. Partitioning of Luciferase (emulating ribosome bound nascent chains)
2. Unfolding and refolding of Yeast PGK and E. coli PGK
3. Kinetic partitioning of Luciferase folding simulations
4. Experimental and simulated unfolding of denatured Luciferase

# Fail (results were not at all what I expected)

1. RetroI27
2. PCB of AFM circuit
3. Experimentally making Cys-Protein-Cys repeats
4. Unfolding of FtsZ (problems with surface adhesion)
5. Simulations of the conformational changes in dsDNA and ssDNA
6. Unfolding and refolding of Kimberley Clark protein #1
7. Unfolding and refolding of Kimberley Clark protein #2
8. Folding of Streptavidin (too hard to get results)
9. Luciferase optical-trap experiments (could not get attachement to work)

# Will never finish (not enough results, too time-consuming with low impact, lack of good results/motivation)

1. Unfolding characteristics of Inosine
2. Simulations of ribosome bound nascent chain folding (beat to punch)
3. Experiments of ribosome bound nascent chains
4. AFM imaging of ribosome bound nascent chains
5. Cyro-EM imaging of ribosome bound nascent chains
6. Using Ribosome bound nascent chains as protein purification
7. Testing the unfolding of the Durham firefly Luciferase
8. Luciferase folding with Hsp40/70/90
9. Unfolding and refolding of Hsp70
10. Unfolding and refolding of Taq Polymerase
11. Multilevel simulations (combining coarse-grain and all-atom)
12. Simulations of circularly permutted proteins
13. Electrostatics of ribosome exit tunnel
14. Thermodynamic model of protein folding in exit tunnel
15. SpyCatcher/SpyTag covalent chemistry for attaching proteins
16. Unfolding and refolding of David Baker protein #1 (OCage)
17. Unfolding and refolding of David Baker protein #2 (3n7..)
18. Pulling polydA at different concentrations of Urea (force effects)
19. Unfolding of protein with self-quenching dye
20. polydA and polyrA QM calculations
21. Stop-flow measurements of Protein S

# Finished but probably will never publish (due ot lack of novelty)

1. Design of new AFM circuit
2. Clustering algorithm/program for AFM curves
3. Molecular dynamics vs AFM correlations

# Finished and could be published

1. Protein S unfolding/folding
2. Anisotropy of unfolding (SpyCatcher/SpyTag)
3. Unbinding transitions in Streptavidin/Biotin
4. Luciferase unfolding kinetics
5. Luciferase splitting in proportion to ATP/Luciferin concentration
7. AFM Imaging of Ribosomes
8. Unfolding of ELPs (in context of greater material)
9. Unfolding of ELPs with metals
10. Unfolding of Kimberley Clark protein #3

# Published

1. Automation of AFM
2. Luciferase refolding and unfolding
3. Streptavidin stabilization during unfolding
4. Mechanical induced conformational changes of polydA
