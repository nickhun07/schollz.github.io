description: What were the science ideas that succeeded and failed?

*Not including rotations*

*All these are projects that I spent at least a week on, sometimes quite more*

# Working on

1. Partitioning of Luciferase (emulating ribosome bound nascent chains)
2. Unfolding and refolding of Yeast PGK and E. coli PGK
3. Kinetic partitioning of Luciferase folding simulations

# Fail (didn't work at all)

1. RetroI27
2. PCB of AFM circuit

# Will never finish (lack of good results/motivation)

1. Unfolding characteristics of Inosine
2. Simulations of ribosome bound nascent chain folding (beat to punch)
3. Experiments of ribosome bound nascent chains
4. AFM imaging of ribosome bound nascent chains
5. Cyro-EM imaging of ribosome bound nascent chains
6. Using Ribosome bound nascent chains as protein purification
7. Testing the unfolding of the Durham firefly Luciferase
8. Luciferase folding with Hsp40/70/90
9. Unfolding and refolding of Hsp70
10. Unfolding and refolding of Taq Polymerase
11. Multilevel simulations (combining coarse-grain and all-atom)

# Finished but probably will never publish (due ot lack of novelty)

1. Design of new AFM circuit
2. Clustering algorithm/program for AFM curves

# Finished and could be published

1. Protein S unfolding/folding
2. Anisotropy of unfolding (SpyCatcher/SpyTag)
3. Unbinding transitions in Streptavidin/Biotin
4. Luciferase unfolding kinetics
5. Luciferase splitting in proportion to ATP/Luciferin concentration
7. AFM Imaging of Ribosomes

# Published

1. Automation of AFM
2. Luciferase refolding and unfolding
3. Streptavidin stabilization during unfolding
4. Mechanical induced conformational changes of polydA
