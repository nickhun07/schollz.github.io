description: What were the science ideas that succeeded and failed?

*Not including rotations*

*All these are projects that I spent at least a week on, sometimes quite more*

# Expectations vs. Reality

1. Takes a long time (TRUE)
2. Its fun if you like to learn (TRUE)
3. One project (FALSE)

## NOTES

3rd/4th year at the limit o f

# Observations

Started 58 projects but ended up publishing only 6.

Ones that failed either because my idea was stupid or because it became impossible to gather data (Kimberely Clark proteins, FtsZ, 5 data points a week... and I have no ideas how to troubleshoot)

Projects that were abandoned had a very low impact to time-investment ratio or were done by other groups in a way that I don't think I could compete with

Projects that were finished but never published were things that improved software or hardware by making them less expensive (AFM circuit) or minimized time-consuming processes (clustering) but weren't nessecarily novel.

Finished and could be published are projects that I initially had as part of another project but my advisor had me cut out to make the story more concise.

Most published projects are 2-3 of these individual projects combined.

# Working on

1. Partitioning of Luciferase (emulating ribosome bound nascent chains)
2. Cotranslational folding of proteins
3. Unfolding of Kimberley Clark protein #3
4. PCNA
5. Taq polymerase

# Fail (simply didn't work or not likely to yield much useful data)

1. RetroI27
2. PCB of AFM circuit
3. Experimentally making Cys-Protein-Cys repeats
4. Unfolding of FtsZ (problems with surface adhesion)
5. Simulations of the conformational changes in dsDNA and ssDNA
6. Unfolding and refolding of Kimberley Clark protein #1
7. Unfolding and refolding of Kimberley Clark protein #2
8. Folding of Streptavidin (too hard to get results)
9. Luciferase optical-trap experiments (could not get attachement to work)
10. Refolding Luciferase with individual heat shock proteins

# Started but likely will never finish (too time-consuming with low impact)

1. Unfolding characteristics of Inosine
2. Simulations of ribosome bound nascent chain folding (beat to punch)
3. Experiments of ribosome bound nascent chains
