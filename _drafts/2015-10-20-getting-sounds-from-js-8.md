# Create the JS-8

You'll need to create a fake JS-8 device. To do this you basically download the backup data and then format a thumbdrive so that it *looks* like a JS-8 device.

1. [Download eBand JS-8 factory installed data in the included SD Card](http://roland.com/support/article/?q=downloads&p=JS-8&id=62153672)
2. Insert a thumbdrive, format it and name is "JS-8". 
3. Unzip the "eBand JS-8 factory installed data in the included SD Card" and drag the "ROLAND" folder onto the newly formatted
thumbdrive.

# Launch the program to export the files

1. [Download the eBand Song List Editor Ver.1.01 for Windows](http://www.boss.info/support/by_product/eband_js-10/updates_drivers/5410)
2. Unzip, then install "eBand Song List Editor"
3. Open "eBand Song List Editor", it will come up with the songs ready to export.
