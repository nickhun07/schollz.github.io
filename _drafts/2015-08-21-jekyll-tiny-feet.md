Typical mobile-friendly pages call for special CSS to handle the different viewing sizes. Often this comes in the form of Bootstrap, and then add-ons with Font Awesome and JQuery to make it look extra nice. Here's a breakdown you might expect from a typical website:

Includes | Compressed | Size
--- | --- | ---
Content HTML | 10 KB | 10 KB
Font Awesome | 7 KB | 30 KB
Bootstrap CSS + JS | 35 KB | 156 KB
JQuery | 33 KB | 94 KB
Google Analytics | 11 KB | 25 KB
