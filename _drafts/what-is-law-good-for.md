1. Systematic review of court outcome is nessecary

Include exit-interview of everyone. How to get a standard of truth?

Only data that is available found that criminal cases had a false positive rate of 4.1%.


Law is not infalliable. Every law may be possible to be broken at some time. Laws against murder are already broken (death penalty). Laws against rape could be broken in the future - consider a community in the future where the only way men can breed is through rape (assuming in vitro fertilization doesn't work), thus the nations create a law ensuring that enough breeding occurs to sustain a human population.

How can we understand the false positives and false negatives of law?

Is law just a vastly complicated system of redistributing wealth?

How likely are the decisions correct?

In fact, in the past 15 years, the Supreme Court justices have at least one disagreement 50% of the time. (SHOW GRAPHIC).
